Description: Once loaded, this package defines a custom Knitr engine called 
    octave.connect with a chunk option called r_array, which takes a character
    string corresponding to the name of an R array and passes the data in that
    array to Octave, so that Octave commands in the chunk can manipulate the
    array.
